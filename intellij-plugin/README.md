## Compose Multiplatform plugin for IntelliJ Idea.

Still under heavy development!

Currently this plugin needs IntelliJ 2024.3 as minimum. Or Android Studio Meerkat (Canary build currently)



To run the example:

1. from directory `compose-jb/examples/intellij-plugin`:

* Run command in terminal `./gradlew runIde`.
* Or choose **runIde** configuration in IDE and run it.

2. create project or open any existing
3. Open a kotlin file
4. Annotate a composable function with the @HotPreview
